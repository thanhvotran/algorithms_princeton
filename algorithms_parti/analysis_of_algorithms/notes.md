# Observations
## measuring the running time
**empirical analysis** run the program for various input sizes and measure running time.

**data analysis** plot running time T(N) vs. input size N using log-log scale, find regression - fit straight line through data points then use hypothesis to predict the running time - **prediction and validation** 

**doubling hypothesis** quick way to estimate b in a power-law relationship.

**experimental algorithmics** system independent effects and system dependent effects. bad new is difficult to report.

# Mathematical models
## total running time
**total running time = sum of cost x frequency for all operations**
system dependent effects again!. and hardware 

** estimating a discrete sum**
**in principle** accurate mathematical models are available
**in practice** formulas can be complicated and advanced mathematics might be required, and we r going to use APPROXIMATE models in here
